# Qubicles eosio Playground for Telos / EOS testnets
Qubicles is the world's first on-demand call center marketplace that runs itself, with no middlemen involved. The power and speed of EOSIO-based software is what allows us to make our vision a reality. As a result, we have committed to supporting EOSIO-based initiatives to help better serve Dapp developers and their users.

We're avid supporters of the EOS mainnet, both as developers and investors. However, we're also strong believers in the vision that Telos has for EOSIO, which is geared towards a more equitable distribution, a friendlier Dapp developer community, a simpler consitution, and more.

This repository contains scripts that could potentially help the greater Telos community further its goal via various tests, serving as a source for some documentation, and the like. Some of these scripts may have been adopted from prior work performed during the EOS Mainnet Launch and credit given to their original authors accordingly.
